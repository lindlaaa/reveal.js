						</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							Git is a file system, like windows explorer, build for linux in the early 2000's by Linus Torvalds.
							Not only was it part of the Linux filesystem, but it has been used to develop Linux since.

						<h2>A timeline</h2>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<span style="font-size: 100px;">&#8595;</span>

						<aside class="notes">
							It not only stores your current files, but records every change made, who made it, as well as a message from the person who made it.

						<h2>A backup</h2>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<span style="font-size: 100px;">&#8595;</span>
						</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							At any point you can revert to an older "commit" point, and your actual files on your disk will change to reflect the state of the file system when the "commit" was made.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>A "shared" filesystem</h2>
						<p>It allows you to work</p>
						<p class="fragment grow highlight-green">with</p>
						<p>other developers and not</p>
						<p class="fragment shrink highlight-red">against!</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-left">This is where our new tools come into play.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Working with others is easy. You can work off of each others commits.
							To do this we can use the command line, but there are tools that can make life easier and take us away from the command line.

						<h5>What is it?</h5>

						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">

						<h2>Source code management tool</h2>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<span style="font-size: 100px;">&#8595;</span>
						</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							This is where we do our code reviews, merge my changes with yours, "checkout" each others
							code to make sure all of the unit tests pass, and where we eventually merge all good code into production.
						</aside>

						<h2>What is it <em>really</em>?</h2>
						<p>It is really just a linux machine, with a fancy GUI attached to it. Underneath are basic Git commands.</p>

				<!-- SourceTree -->
				<section data-background-size="contain" data-background="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/dam/jcr:51aa63f9-8e33-4177-8ef9-54b4bdb09a69/sourcetree_rgb_darkblue_atlassian_1200x630.png"></section>

						<h2>Sourcetree</h2>
						<h5>What is it?</h5>
						<blockquote>"SourceTree simplifies how you interact with your Git repositories so you can focus on coding."</blockquote>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<span style="font-size: 100px;">&#8595;</span>
						</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							Sourcetree is really just a GUI to, once again, use Git on your local computer.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Whats the difference?</h2>
						<p>Everything you can do on BitBucket you can also do on SourceTree, <em>however</em>, others cannot see it!</p>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<span style="font-size: 100px;">&#8595;</span>
						</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							This doesnt just mean you can do things without others knowing, but implies that you can test, modify, improve,
							even break things, without bothering other developers.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>But what if I like my changes?</h2>
						<p>Good news, you can just tell BitBucket about your changes with a "push", and now others will be able to see them!</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							SourceTree makes this very easy, and even updates BitBucket by default. It not only abstracts that task away, but also
							lets you know when other "branches" you are working on are "out-of-date".

						<h2>Jenkins</h2>
						<h5>What is it?</h5>
						<blockquote>"The leading open source automation server, Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project."</blockquote>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<span style="font-size: 100px;">&#8595;</span>
						</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							As the slide says, Jenkins is the leading open source automation tool. Anything that you want automated, Jenkins should be able to do it.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>How useful is this?</h2>
						<h1 class="fragment fade-up grow highlight-green"><em>extremely!</em></h1>
						<aside class="notes">
							In a perfect world, everything would be automated. Even designing and writing the code! We are getting there!...
							In our world, however, we must learn to automate, as it improves quality, consistency, efficiency, and ease of use.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Do we automate now?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Compiling source code from BitBucket</li>
							<li>Adding the new executable to each server</li>
							<li>Anything else?</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							As far as I know, we automate the deployment of code to our development environments. QA and DEV. This is an excellent candidate for automation,
							as this task will always be the same, is prone to breaking with the smallest mistake, and any deviation to the normal build process should
							halt the build!
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>What <em>can</em> we automate?</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Run unit tests everytime code is promoted</li>
							<li>Only run the "deploy" script if all the unit tests pass</li>
							<li>Start a new deploy everytime a story is completed</li>
							<li>Anything you find yourself doing all the time!</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							In my personal opinion, automation is the key to growth. Trying to automate something forces it to be well defined, and a growing
							operation must have well defined and controlled process. Not only this, but automating removes the need for developers to actually
							do this tedious work!

					<section>
						<h2>Why these tools?</h2>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<span style="font-size: 100px;">&#8595;</span>
						</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							There are other tools out there that can accomplish some of the same things, and there are some out there that even do
							parts of it better, however, there are none that integrate so well with each other. BitBucket and SourceTree are made to
							be used in a professional development environment together. Jenkins can be used with anything you like.
						</aside>

						<h2>Additional Tools</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Jira</li>
							<li>BitBucket</li>
							<li>SourceTree</li>
							<li>Jenkins</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Not only is there Sourcetree and Bitbucket that work so well together, but you may have heard of some other new tools.
							Jira is our story tracking tool, which is also made by the same company! You can attach BitBucket "branches" and code reviews
							directly into a Jira story card, or attach JUnit test results directly into a story card! 
							Confluence is another Atlassian tool, and serves a similar purpose as Sharepoint. However, confluence does not have some of 
							the overhead or learning curve to use, so each team can spend more time focusing on good design. Not only that, but you can once
							again include any confluence document or page into any Jira story.
