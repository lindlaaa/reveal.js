						<h2>Git</h2>
						<h5>What is it?</h5>
						<li class="fragment fade-out">an unpleasant or contemptible person.</li>
						<blockquote class="fragment current-visible">"Git:  a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people."</blockquote>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">

						<h2>a filesystem</h2>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<span style="font-size: 100px;">&#8595;</span>
						</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							Git is a file system, like windows explorer, build for linux in the early 2000's by Linus Torvalds.
							Not only was it part of the Linux filesystem, but it has been used to develop Linux since.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>A timeline</h2>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<span style="font-size: 100px;">&#8595;</span>
						</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							It not only stores your current files, but records every change made, who made it, as well as a message from the person who made it.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>A backup</h2>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<span style="font-size: 100px;">&#8595;</span>
						</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							At any point you can revert to an older "commit" point, and your actual files on your disk will change to reflect the state of the file system when the "commit" was made.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>A "shared" filesystem</h2>
						<p>It allows you to work</p>
						<p class="fragment grow highlight-green">with</p>
						<p>other developers and not</p>
						<p class="fragment shrink highlight-red">against!</p>
						<p class="fragment fade-left">This is where our new tools come into play.</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							Working with others is easy. You can work off of each others commits.
							To do this we can use the command line, but there are tools that can make life easier and take us away from the command line.
						</aside>

				<!-- BitBucket -->
				<section data-transition="slide" data-background="#636466" data-background-transition="zoom">

						<h2>bitbucket</h2>
						<h5>What is it?</h5>
						<blockquote>"Distributed version control system that makes it easy for you to collaborate with your team. The only collaborative Git solution that massively scales."</blockquote>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<span style="font-size: 100px;">&#8595;</span>
						</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							Bitbucket is the basically the server that all of our sourcecode is stored on.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Our repository of code</h2>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<span style="font-size: 100px;">&#8595;</span>
						</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							You cannot do any actual development on bitbucket, but you can manage
							all of the commits and sets of commits called branches.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Source code management tool</h2>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<span style="font-size: 100px;">&#8595;</span>
						</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							This is where we do our code reviews, merge my changes with yours, "checkout" each others
							code to make sure all of the unit tests pass, and where we eventually merge all good code into production.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>What is it <em>really</em>?</h2>
						<p>It is really just a linux machine, with a fancy GUI attached to it. Underneath are basic Git commands.</p>
					</section>
				</section>

				<!-- SourceTree -->
				<section data-transition="slide" data-background="#f39000" data-background-transition="zoom">
					<section>
						<h2>Sourcetree</h2>
						<h5>What is it?</h5>
						<blockquote>"SourceTree simplifies how you interact with your Git repositories so you can focus on coding."</blockquote>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<span style="font-size: 100px;">&#8595;</span>
						</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							Sourcetree is really just a GUI to, once again, use Git on your local computer.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Whats the difference?</h2>
						<p>Everything you can do on BitBucket you can also do on SourceTree, <em>however</em>, others cannot see it!</p>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<span style="font-size: 100px;">&#8595;</span>
						</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							This doesnt just mean you can do things without others knowing, but implies that you can test, modify, improve,
							even break things, without bothering other developers.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>But what if I like my changes?</h2>
						<p>Good news, you can just tell BitBucket about your changes with a "push", and now others will be able to see them!</p>
						<aside class="notes">
							SourceTree makes this very easy, and even updates BitBucket by default. It not only abstracts that task away, but also
							lets you know when other "branches" you are working on are "out-of-date".
						</aside>

				<!-- Conclusion -->

					<section>
						<h2>Why these tools?</h2>
						<a href="#" class="navigate-down">
							<span style="font-size: 100px;">&#8595;</span>
						</a>
						<aside class="notes">
							There are other tools out there that can accomplish some of the same things, and there are some out there that even do
							parts of it better, however, there are none that integrate so well with each other. BitBucket and SourceTree are made to
							be used in a professional development environment together.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Additional Tools</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Jira</li>
							<li>BitBucket</li>
							<li>SourceTree</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Not only is there Sourcetree and Bitbucket that work so well together, but you may have heard of some other new tools.
							Jira is our story tracking tool, which is also made by the same company! You can attach BitBucket "branches" and code reviews
							directly into a Jira story card, or attach JUnit test results directly into a story card! 
							Confluence is another Atlassian tool, and serves a similar purpose as Sharepoint. However, confluence does not have some of 
							the overhead or learning curve to use, so each team can spend more time focusing on good design. Not only that, but you can once
							again include any confluence document or page into any Jira story.
